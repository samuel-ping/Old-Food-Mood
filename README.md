# Food Mood
### This is my original submission to the Capital One challenge. I'm improving my website in a separate repo on GitHub!
## About
This web app was built as an entry to Capital One's Software Engineering Summit challenge. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, and Node.js. The challenge was to create a web app using Yelp's Fusion API to help you choose a restaurant. This web app takes your selfie (plus whoever you're with), and using Amazon's Rekognition API, determines the most visible emotion in the photo. Then, using Yelp's Fusion API, it searches for a restaurant based on your mood!
## How To Use
Just take a photo or browse your device for a selfie. After entering your photo, just wait a few seconds, and your restaurant suggestion will pop up underneath the (not working) Google Map! Note that you need location permissions turned on for this to work.
## Future Improvements
I would definitely make determining the most visible emotion more accurate. I would also increase the number of restaurant suggestions shown. My original plan was to have page redirects, and I still hope to integrate that into this web app. Also, my Express.js code needs to be cleaned up.
